    <p class="margin-p">My name is David, I am 19 years old and will be 20 in January. I'm studying at the second year of Alatoo International University at (strangely enough) the faculty of software engineering. 
    Before that I studied at school-gymnasium â„–6. </p>
    <p class="margin-p">My hobby for a long time was video games, in particular online games. My most recent hobby is translating web novels from English into Russian, 
    I guess you could say that reading is my hobby, however, I don't do either of those things much anymore.</p>
    <p class="margin-p">I am also very good friends with technology since my childhood, coupled with my "not bad math mind" my direction at university was literally predetermined, although 
    I originally wanted to go into management.
    Somehow, thanks to all these coincidences I am here now, and that's why you see this page :)</p>
    <p class="margin-p">(I hope you will see something effective from me in the future, mot this page, which I made with very little html&css writing experience).</p>
